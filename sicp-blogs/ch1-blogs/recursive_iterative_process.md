# Procedures and the processes they Generate

---
**Recursive procedures**: Procedures that are defined in terms of itsel.

Example:

Factorial function can be defined as

n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) ......... 3 * 2 * 1

---
## Methods to calculate the factorial

**Method1:** n! is equal to n times (n - 1)! for any positive integer n.

n! = n * (n - 1)!
