;; recursive procedure --> recursive process
;; Above factorial procedure is recusive, it genrate recursive process
;; It's shape fist expand then contract
;; we can predict this procedure will generate recusive process by looking on single line i.e (* x (factorial (- x 1)))
;; It will expand along symbol *
;; It will require an amount of memory which grow with no of procedure call,
;; It will need of stack which keep track of operation performed on time of contraction

;; Interpreter need to keep track of amount of information which can grow (linerly with n in above example)
