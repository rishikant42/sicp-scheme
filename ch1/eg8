;; about fact-iter procedure
;; recursive procedure --> iterative process ==> tail recursive
;; require constant amount of memory
;; tail recursive is compiler optimization trick
;; It's tail recursive can be predict by looking last line i.e (fact-iter (* counter product) (+ counter 1) max-count)

;; Interpreter need to keep track of fixed amount of memory (in above exmpl: product, counter & max-counter needed)

;; defination
;; Recusive procedure --> Proceduce which call itself (directly or indirectly)

;; Recursive process --> whose shape first exapnd then contract along some operator
;;                   --> having syntax like
;;                   --> (operator (fn prmtr))


;; Iterative process --> whose state can be sumarized by fixed no of state variables 
;;                   --> Interpreter require to keep fixed amount of variable in order to execute process
;;                   --> having syntax like 
;;                   --> (fn prmtr)

;; tail recursive  --> procedure will call itself at the bottom of body
;;                 --> Recursive procedure + iterative process
